# Introduction

This project explores the top-paying jobs within data analytics and I discover the most in-demand skills for those roles.

This is my first data analytics project and I followed a guide on YouTube linked below. Questions 1-5 are straight from the course but I also added questions 6-10 to test myself.

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    jp.job_title,
    ROUND(jp.salary_year_avg / 1000.0, 1) || 'k' AS salary_year_avg,
    jp.job_location,
    c.name AS company_name,
    jp.job_schedule_type,
    jp.job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact jp
LEFT JOIN company_dim c
ON jp.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND jp.job_location = 'Anywhere'
AND jp.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY jp.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184k to $650k, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specialisations within data analytics.
